All Facts about ET

The ET language has been designed by Max Base in 2012, Which was later developed by the Asrez
team. They tried to design a modern, more appropriate language. As simple as possible for humans.
Some features of the ET language:

- ET Language is a middle-level language. Programming languages can be divided into three
categories: high-level languages, middle level, low-level languages. (Table 1-1) The reason
for the middle-level language is that it is also low because it is capable of being closely related
to the hardware, like the assembly. And on the other side it is close to human expression and
has simple commands and is readiable for humans then this’s a feature of the high level
languages.

- ET language is a flexible and powerful language that does not create any restrictions for the
programmer, and you can take and create whatever you think.

- ET language is a portable language. This means that you can run the code written in a system
on another system. Without causing trouble or trouble.

- ET language is a multi-platform language. This means that when you design an application
for the Windows operating system. You can run it on another operating system, including
Linux series.

- The ET programming language has the ability to embed on a platform for another platform.
So you can design a program for Windows. You will not need to own a Windows operating
system. And this is a unique and wonderful feature.

- The ET programming language has tiny keywords. This means that the number of keywords
in this language is small. But this does not make you curious or can not produce any program.
However, the number of keywords is not a reason for the strength and speed of the compiler.
But these are the reasons for learning this programming language easier and faster.


Keywords: 
1. auto 
2. const 
3. break 
4. continue 
5. return 
6. if 
7. for 
8. foreach 
9. loop 
10. while 
11. do 
12. default 
13. switch 
14. else 
15. elseif 
16. elif 
17. extern 
18. struct 
19. enum 
20. static
goto union case register typedef assembly import ifdef ifndef define
